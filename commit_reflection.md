# Commit Reflection

## Can I clearly track the development of my website through my commits?
* I think that I can track the development of my website through my commits by labeling my progress in the commits with titles. When finishing a commit dedicated to an assignment on Canvas, I will put the name of the assignment within the commit next to its title.
## How effectively do the commit messages communicate what I was doing?
* I believe that my method of committing messages is clear about how I was working. Within the message commits, I plainly state what actions have been completed within the commit.
## How might I embed this process, or something similar in other places of my life?
* I already use this process in my daily life. When working on projects, we label our work as it's being done. When I read books for discussions at school, we annotate, allowing us to look back later to understand.
